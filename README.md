# SAT Roadmap Dashboard

## Overview

I took the approach of finding the core pain points that students preparing for the SAT encounter, then designed the dashboards functionality around those - uncertainty, inefficient study choices, and loss of momentum. This dashboard addresses those core challenges through a metric roadmap, always directs effort toward the next best high impact topic, and sustains motivation by making progress visible. The result is a guided experience where students always know where they stand, what to do next, and why it matters.

## About This Project

I was experimenting with new AI tools and it created
the base project around an Express - Node hybrid so I figured I'd make it work, but it made
deployment flaky so I included SS's in the release page of the repo. Thanks for the oppurtunity.
