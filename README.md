# SAT Roadmap Dashboard

## Overview

This dashboard is designed to tackle the three primary hurdles students encounter during SAT preparation: uncertainty, inefficient study habits, and flagging motivation. It brings clarity by offering a visual readiness indicator and a comprehensive study roadmap. It optimizes effort by directing students towards high-impact topics with adaptive recommendations. Finally, it sustains motivation by making progress tangible and the learning process manageable. The outcome is a guided, intuitive experience where students are always aware of their current standing, their next steps, and the significance of their efforts.

## About This Project

This project began as an experiment with new AI tools, which generated the base structure as an Express-Node hybrid. Adapting and deploying this unique setup presented its own set of challenges, leading to some flaky deployments. Screenshots detailing these experiences are available on the repository's release page. It's been an insightful journey, and I appreciate the opportunity to bring this vision to life.
